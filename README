README FOR BOOKSTORE SALE PROBLEM
#################################

To compile 
	$ javac BookstoreSale.java

To run with default values
	$ java BookstoreSale

To run with custom values
	$ java BookstoreSale {initial price} {discount} {floor price} {budget}
	ex: java BookstoreSale 50 4 25 300


BookstoreSale.java contains the BookstoreSale class and 3 methods
	* main
		If command-line parameters are passed, then those values will be used instead of default

		By default, this solves BookstoreSale problem with values
			Initial book price:	50
			Discount between books:	4
			"Floor" book price:	25
			Budget:			300		
		
	* calcMaxPurchase
		Easy-to-read version with O(n) runtime.  Iterative solution

	* fastCalcMaxPurchase
		If "floor" pricing is invoked, then O(1) runtime [constant]
		This is less easy to read/support, but provides significant speed saving
